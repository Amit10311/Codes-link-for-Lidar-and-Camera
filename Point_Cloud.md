## Point Cloud Documentation and References

**What is a Point Cloud?**

A point cloud is a collection of data points in 3D space, often representing the external surface of an object or environment. 
Each point contains coordinates (x, y, z) and may also include additional information such as intensity, color, or normal vectors.

**Point Cloud Formats**

1. **.PCD** (Point Cloud Data):
    - Native format for the Point Cloud Library.
2. **.PLY** (Polygon File Format):
    - Widely supported format with additional support for color and other attributes.
3. **.LAS/.LAZ**:
    - Common formats for Lidar point cloud data.
4. **.OBJ**:
    - Often used for 3D models that include surfaces.

#### **2.2. Point-Based Methods**
* Suitable for in-door scenes (high object density) not for out-door ( large scale point clouds). 
* These methods process raw point clouds directly and are often suitable for high-density, indoor scenes.
