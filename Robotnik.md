    * The objective is to maintain a constant and dynamic pace in the process of collecting indoor and outdoor environmental information. 
    * For this case of Lean construction through mobile robotics, the SUMMIT-XL travels around the construction site and performs a scan to compare the real state of the same, comparing it with the plans of the 3D BIM model. 
    * The evaluation of the construction site against the BIM map serves to confirm that the project is progressing as planned.
