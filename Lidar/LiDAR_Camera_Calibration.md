1. **Apollo Sensor Calibration Tools**: This tool provides a **targetless calibration method** and is integrated into Apolloâ€™s autonomous driving system. You can follow the official guide to use it, but note that the source code is not available.
   
2. **OpenCalib**: OpenCalib offers both **target-based and target-less calibration methods**. It is a more flexible solution for sensor calibration in autonomous vehicles. You can find detailed documentation and source code in the [OpenCalib GitHub repository](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration).

3. **tier4/CalibrationTools**: This set of tools from **Tier 4** is designed for **target-based calibration** and includes manual methods. It's useful for fine-tuning sensor configurations in autonomous driving platforms. You can find the source code and documentation on the [Tier4 CalibrationTools GitHub repository](https://github.com/tier4/CalibrationTools).
