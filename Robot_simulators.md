# ROS2 robot simulators 

1. **Autonomous mobile robots (2WD, 4WD, Mecanum Drive)**
   * https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot2/tree/humble
   * linorobot2 is a ROS2 implementation of the [linorobot](https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot) package for building custom robots with 2WD, 4WD, or Mecanum drive configurations.
   * This package provides launch files for Nav2 integration and includes a complete simulation pipeline in Gazebo.

2. **ROS2-Gazebo simulation package leveraging Mid360 and FASTLIO for navigation.***
   - **https://gitee.com/SMBU-POLARBEAR/pb_rm_simulation**
   - Contains Docker config

3. **Int-Ball2 Technology Demonstration Platform ROS/Gazebo Simulator**
   - https://github.com/jaxa/int-ball2_simulator/tree/main
   - Int-Ball2 (JEM Internal Ball Camera 2 System) is a free-flying camera robot deployed in the ISS Japan Experimental Module (JEM).
   - It is remotely controlled from the ground to capture video images and support astronauts.
   - Additionally, Int-Ball2 can run user-developed software as an extended functionality and can be used as a platform for demonstrating robotic technology in space.
